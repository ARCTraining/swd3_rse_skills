# About the solutions

The solutions to the workshop can be found here. 

They follow the convention used in the workshop.

In the case of the script `03_country-subset.py` you will find also a `03_country-subset-forTest`
the first one is the one you are given at the beginning and the second one (forTest) is the 
modified version for the testing sections.

The exploratory notebook also has two versions: the original notebook and a second version
which includes some tests inside the notebook.


You can also find here the `environment.yml` and `.travis.yml` files for the Continuous Integration sections
